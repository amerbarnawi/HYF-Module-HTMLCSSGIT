CLI - Questions:

1-How do I create a hidden file or folder ? How do I display it in the CLI ?

To create a folder you can use the command ( mkdir folder-name ) , to hide this folder ..
you can use the command ( mv folder-name .folder-name ) which mean to put (.) before the folder-name.
To create a file,you can use the command ( touch file-name ) and to hide it you can put (.) before the file-name with the command mv 
: ( mv file-name .file-name)

you can display the hidden file or folder by command ( ls -a ).


2- How do I create multiple nested directories?

to creat folders you can use ( mkdir ) with flag ( -p ):

mkdir -p folder1/folder2/folder3 ...



3- How I append a message to a file, without a newline character?

I understood you want like this ( firstmessage-secondmessage) without a newline character ( it will appear without - ).

for that, you can use ( touch filename.txt ) to creat a new file.
then, the command ( echo -n "firstmessage" >> filename.txt).
after that, the command ( echo -n " secondmessage" >> filename.txt ).
the command ( cat filename.txt ) to see the result.
